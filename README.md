# Smoove

This project was created together as a co-project together with Computer Graphics students and Digital designer students. The assignment we was given was to create a landing-page for a new veicle called Smoove.

The aim of this project is to combine our skills and put together a functional landing page that has a mobile-first view but also is desktop friendly.
